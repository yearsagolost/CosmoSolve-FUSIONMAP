# FUSIONMAP — AI-Powered Satellite Fusion for Disaster Detection

FUSIONMAP is an AI-powered satellite fusion system that combines Optical and SAR imagery to detect natural disasters earlier, faster, and more accurately. The system analyzes ground deformation, water level rise, vegetation loss, and structural damage in real time to generate actionable risk maps for emergency teams.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion (SAR + Optical)**  
  Works in any weather and at night, overcoming cloud and smoke limitations.

- **Real-Time Risk Mapping**  
  Automatically generates flood, landslide, wildfire, and earthquake impact maps.

- **High Accuracy (90%+)**  
  AI-based fusion models deliver reliable early warnings.

- **Situational Awareness Dashboard**  
  Web-based map viewer for emergency & government agencies.

## 🛰️ Problem We Solve
Natural disasters are often detected too late due to:
- Cloud-covered optical imagery  
- Slow manual analysis  
- Lack of unified satellite data  
- Low situational awareness during emergencies  

FUSIONMAP solves this by fusing SAR + optical data and automating detection.
